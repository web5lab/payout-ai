## Monitoring and Alerting Setup

### Critical Alerts
```javascript
// Example monitoring configuration
const criticalAlerts = {
    largeInvestments: {
        threshold: ethers.parseUnits("50000", 18), // $50k
        action: "immediate_review"
    },
    oraclePriceDeviation: {
        threshold: 10, // 10% deviation
        action: "pause_system"
    },
    emergencyFunctionUsage: {
        events: ["EmergencyUnlockEnabled", "RefundsEnabled"],
        action: "notify_team"
    },
    failedTransactions: {
        threshold: 5, // 5 failures in 1 hour
        action: "investigate"
    }
};
```

### Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Track gas usage trends
- [ ] Monitor transaction success rates
- [ ] Track user adoption metrics
- [ ] Monitor contract balance changes

### Security Monitoring
- [ ] Track unusual transaction patterns
